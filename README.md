# Lan2

## What is Lan2

Language, its second version. Lan2 lets you easily create flow charts. It is based on the concept of conception and perception. 

- Conception:

Conception makes reference to the conception, creation of data. It can be anything, text, a list of tasks, an API, an image ... What ever you want. You can freely connect, parse, index all this data as you wish. This would make it an organized set of information.

- Perception:

Information alone is not enough. We must process, interpret it. Thats how we give this information a meaning. We have to perceive these data. In order to perceive these data we apply mathematic logic and provide some boolean outputs true/false, that can lead into actions.


In other words, Lan2 lets you handle information as if you were coding, but without coding. Brings engineering, mathematics and logic into any area you want. It is a tool to manage any type of data as if it was a mathematical function.

This can lead to numerous applications, you can create hyper interactive workflows, gather data for building an AI, explain code or concepts in a more visual manner ...

The limits are set by your imagination.


## How it is built

Lan2 has 3 main interfaces. The board (conception), where you add your data. The queries, where you can query all your existing data (from the conception and perception, board and functions). It is a more traditional way of viewing your data. Finally, the functions (perception) where you set the ways you want to interpret this data. Let's dive into each of this interfaces and see their features and how they work.

### Board

By clicking you add concepts (green). You can click the nodes appearning on the sides of concepts to create connections. Concepts can contain some data. This can be a link, an image or a file. 


### Query


### Function


## How to use it

## Unit tests

### Test 1

Mass **affect** gravity

Distance **affect** gravity

**Universal** law of gravitation.

Gravity **is inversely proportional to** the square of the distance

**Fundamental** principle of classical mechanics.
